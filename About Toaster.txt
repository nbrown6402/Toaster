This program is a program coded in C for ECE 251 Engineering Programming I, which was then run 
with a Cuisinaart CPT-420C Toaster. The user would run the code and control the toaster from MingW 
or any C compiler. The user is then prompted with the normal toaster functions of toast, bagel, 
change darkness, defrost and reheat. The user is then surprised with wonderful ascii art while 
they wait for their food item to be heated. 

To run this program please compile toastman.c. Since the toaster programs to run the actual 
toaster were not given to me serialsim.c and serialsim.h are included in place of these, so
the program will still run in a C compiler.
