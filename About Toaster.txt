This program is a program coded in C++ which was then run with a Cuisinaart CPT-420C Toaster.
The user would run the code and control the toaster from MingW or any C++ compiler. The user 
is then prompted with the normal toaster functions of toast, bagel, change darkness, defrost 
and reheat. The user is then surprised with wonderful ascii art while they wait for their
food item to be heated.
